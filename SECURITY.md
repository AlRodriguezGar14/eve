## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not submit an issue or pull request**: this might reveal the vulnerability.

Instead, you should use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/cezelot/eve/security/advisories/new) tab,
or you can email me directly at: [**cezelot@proton.me**](mailto:cezelot@proton.me).

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.
