# eve

A terminal-based text editor.

### Description

This project was created as part of my learning of the C programming language.
The goal is to create a text editor from scratch. For now the program can only
display a text file with:
```shell
make
./eve <filename>
# Ctrl+Q to exit
```
I will add other features over time.
